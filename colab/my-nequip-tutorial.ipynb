This tutorial serves as a simple introduction into the NequIP code. \n","\n","The goal of NequIP is to be as simple as possible. You will never have to write a single line of Python, but instead you can train a network with one single command and you will be ready to run MD with it in LAMMPS or ASE. \n","\n","Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29939-5\n","\n","Code: https://github.com/mir-group/nequip"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_8gImqa_N_e1"},"source":["## Contents\n","\n","This tutorial will teach you how to:\n","\n","* Train a model \n","* Deploy the model intro production\n","* Run MD with it in LAMMPS\n","\n","We will do all this in this Colab, including LAMMPS.
